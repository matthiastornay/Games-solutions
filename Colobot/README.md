# Colobot
These are some of the scripts I've written some years ago while playing Colobot. It was a pretty cool educational 3D game.
I want to save them here, you never know a moment of nostalgia pushes me to play again. The sources are on github : https://github.com/colobot/colobot.

NB : The files aren't natively extended in .c but .txt, they've been modified to be colourized.
