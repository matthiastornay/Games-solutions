# LEEKWARS ! 

LeekWars is a game where the objective is to develop your own artificial intelligence with LeekScript, an easy to lean language based on JavaScript. The AIs are then loaded into leeks of combat (literally) which you need to confront against other players. They then acquire experience, characteristics, invocations, skills, weapons, and new functions specific to LeekScript.
